C# Plugin for the mod

Want to swing around an untextured Manhattan? This is the mod for you!

Wasn't really planning to release this since an official level editor is in the works. However there seemed to be enough demand for it, so here you go!

This mod has 2 different scaling modes, a 2:1 scale and a 1:1 scale. The 2:1 scale is default.

**Make sure the Jet Island window has focus and press the N key to toggle between sizes.**

Might be a good idea to leave the city first though or you may fall!
